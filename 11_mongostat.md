# MongoDB Monitoring and Performance Analysis

**Lesson Objectives:**
- Understanding MongoDB monitoring tools and their applications
- Learning to analyze MongoDB performance metrics
- Implementing monitoring solutions for database management

**1. MongoDB Monitoring with mongostat**

**Overview:**
Mongostat is a diagnostic tool that provides a real-time view of database performance metrics.

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- Insert/Query/Update/Delete operations per second
- Memory usage statistics
- Connection counts
- Lock percentage
- Queue length

**Basic mongostat Usage:**
bash
mongostat --port 
**2. Memory and I/O Performance Analysis**

**Memory Metrics:**
- Resident Memory (RSS)
- Virtual Memory
- Page Faults
- Mapped Memory

**I/O Performance Indicators:**
- Read/Write Operations
- Queue Length
- Latency
- IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)

**Best Practices:**
- Monitor page faults to identify memory constraints
- Track disk I/O for bottleneck identification
- Analyze connection patterns
- Review index usage statistics

**3. Integration with Enterprise Monitoring Tools**

**Nagios Integration:**
- Install MongoDB plugins
- Configure check commands
- Set up alerts for:
  - Server availability
  - Replication lag
  - Connection threshold
  - Memory usage

**Munin/Cacti Setup:**
- Install MongoDB plugins
- Configure data collection intervals
- Set up graphing for:
  - Operation counts
  - Memory usage
  - Connection trends
  - Queue statistics

**4. MongoDB Web Console**

**Features:**
- Real-time server statistics
- Database operations monitoring
- Storage engine metrics
- Connection management

**Key Monitoring Areas:**
- Database size and growth
- Collection statistics
- Index usage
- User authentication

**Practical Exercise:**
1. Set up mongostat monitoring
2. Configure basic Nagios alerts
3. Implement performance baseline monitoring
4. Create custom monitoring dashboards

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Understanding of monitoring tools
- Ability to interpret performance metrics
- Implementation of monitoring solutions
- Troubleshooting capabilities
